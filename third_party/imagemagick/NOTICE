## License Information

ImageMagick is licensed under the ImageMagick License (see `/LICENSES/ImageMagick.txt`), which is an Apache-like permissive license.

Full license text: https://imagemagick.org/script/license.php

## Description

ImageMagick® is a free, open-source software suite for displaying, converting, and editing raster image and vector image files. It can read and write over 200 image file formats.

Key features used by Nameback:
- HEIC/HEIF image format support
- Image format conversion
- Image processing and manipulation

## Usage in Nameback

Nameback uses ImageMagick (specifically the `magick` command) to enable HEIC/HEIF image support on Windows and Linux platforms. ImageMagick is an optional dependency that enables HEIC image format handling.

Note: On macOS, HEIC support is provided natively by the system, so ImageMagick is not required.
